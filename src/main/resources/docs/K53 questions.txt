Use only the right foot for the accelerator.
The accelerator is used in coniunction with the clutch when a vehide

once the vehicle is moving, grodually increase the pressure on the
accelerator until there is enough speed for onother gear lo be selecred
(Chonging gear will be exploined more fully loier on in the book.)
Do not move your foot up and down while using the occelerolor.
Always use the accelerator gently and grodually in order to mointoin
o constont smooth movement.
The foot broke is used to stop the vehicle.
The right foot is used for borh broking and occeleroting, and olternotes between these two pedols.
Do not ever slom your foot onto the broke pedal os this coutd cause
the brakes to lock and may leod to loss of control of the vehicle.
lf the brakes lock, release the pressure on the pedal and then broke
gently ogoin.
All broking must be completed before turning, if possible.
Moke sure that both hands stoy on the sleering wheel while broking
Do not change to a lower gear lo ossist broking.
Remember to use the clutch for every gear change.
The left foot is used exclusively on the clutch and nowhere else.
The foot movement is foirly fost when pushing in but much slower on
the release. lt is essentiol that you leorn smoolh clutch control.
Your foot must never rest on the clutch pedal and depress if slightly
Anchoring the left foot to the floor may help with clutch control.

too sharp, and the right hand is not moving the steering wheel.
. Some monufocturers suggest that vehicles shoutd be left in either first or
reverse gear when theyareparked on on incline.
This is to avoid ony chonce of rolling downhill.
The bottom photogroph on the right shows the parking broke in the UP position.
. The parking broke is moinly used when the vehicle is left unottended,
but olso on inclines and during complete stops.
. During your test the parking broke will ensure that when the vehicle hos
stopped it does not roll forword or bockwords, which woutd meon instoni failure.
. When you pull the parking broke up, the clicking notse from the rotchet must
not be heord.
. Since the parking broke on most vehicles works only on the reor wheels,
ii shoutd only be used to stop the vehicle in on emergency.
. lf the vehicle is moving fost and the parking broke is used,
it coutd couiie a skid and loss of conlrol.
. Keep your hands on the steering wheel until the vehicle hos completely
stopped. Only then use the parking broke.
. The parking broke must be pulled up before the gear lever is put into neutrol.
. To release the parking broke when it is completely up, the broke lever must be
pulled up iust a little before you push the thumb button in os for os possible.
Only release thq butfon when the lever hos been pushed right down to the floor.

Always siop the vehicle wilh both hands on the steering wheel.
Do nof try to do something else (like tolking on a cellphone)
while turning the steering wheel.
Use only the push-pull ("shuffle") steering method when turning corrrers
os this ensures that both hands olways remoin on the wheel.
This is much sofer, and more controlled and comfortoble.
Do not turn the steering wheel while the vehicle is stationery os yorJ
coutd domoge the tyres and the gearbox.
Never release both hands from the sleering wheel oi the some time b
ollow the wheel to centre itself.
Do not grip the wheel too tightly when turning, os this will cause
sudden lerky movements.
When you toke one hand off the steering wheel to change gears,
put it bock ogoin immediately ofter use.
Use only the "len lo two" or "quorter to lhree" positions when steering,
not the lower holf of the steering wheel.
When holding the steering wheel, keep both thumbs on the inside rim-
. The indicotor lever can be found on either sides of the steering wheel,
depending on the make of the vehicle.
a
a
To ensure that you signal in the correct direction while you arebecoming fomilior with the indicolors, push the lever in the direction
you areturning the steering wheel.
Remember olways to signal only in the direcfion you want to turn.
Always pul on the indicotor roughly 100 m, or 5 seconds, from your
turn, unless there is onother vehicle coming out of a side road or exit and it is unsafe to do so. lndicoiing in good time will allow other
vehicles to odiust to the turn you areabout to moke.
lf your turn is only slight and the indicotor does not turn off by itself,
you must put it off immediately ofter the monoeuvre, so that you do nol
misleod other drivers and cause on occident.
lf possible, use only your fingers to operote the indicotor lever.
Try not lo move your hand off the steering wheel.
When the vehicle is slotionory and you inlend moving either forword
or bockwords, it is besi to worn olher  road  users of your intenlions by
putting on your indicotor.
Windscreen wipersareused moinly when it is roining to ensure good
vision by cleoring the windscreen of woler or moisture build-up.
Keep a check on the windscreen wiper blodes os with oge they con
horden, perish, crock or teor. ldeolly, you shoutd reploce them every
six months or so to ensure that you olways have good working blodes.
lf there is dirt, sond or solt on the windscreen, squirl a iet of cleon
woler on to the gloss before using the wiper.
lf you use the wipers on a dry or dirty windscreen, they will scrotch the
gloss to some degree. Eventuolly lhese scrolches might cause glore on
the windscreen, which coutd blind you or obscure your view of the road and leod to on occident.

You shoutd check the front and reor lights of the vehicle at leosf
once a doy to see lhot theyareworking.
lf one of your bulbs is not working or the lens is broken,
reploce it os soon os possible.
Remember to switch on the lights between sunsel and sunrise, and in bod weother when other road usersarenot cleorly visible
from obout'150 m.
Use the bright heodlight setting only when there is no oncoming
traffic, since you coutd blind the drivers of approaching vehicles and cause on occident.
The hooter is normolly situoted on the steering wheel;
if not, find out where it is in your vehicle.
Hooting does not give you right of way.
Your hooter must be heord from a distqnce of roughly 90 m oway.
The hooier is only a warning device.
Do not hoot in front of hospitols or churches unless it is unovoidoble.
Only hoot to olert olher road users of your presence.
Do not hoot for longer lhon necessory.
When overtoking pedestrians or cyclists, give a shori burst of the
hooter to avoid stortling them.
Always check in your mirror before hooting.
Your instructor will exploin how to odiusf the mirrors properly and will exploin the blind spot area.
A. The centre (reor-view) mirror:
lf this is odiusted correctly you will be oble to see cleorly through
the reor window without too much inierference from the top, bottom
or sides of the interior of the vehicle. Always keep the passoge of
vision cleor in this area because it is the moin mirror check that will
be used during the K53 parking and driving test.
B. The righr- and left-hand side mirrors:
Theseareaptionol on a light motor vehicle, but theyarevery
handy to have os they show areas, such os blind spots,
which you might not be oble to see in the cenlre mirror.
Theyareporticulorly useful when you change lanes or perform ony
lqterol movement. Try to odiust the side mirrors so that you con
cleorly see the vehicles to the right and left of your vehicle. After
you have sel your mirrors correclly, osk someone to wolk around
the vehicle and slond in both blind spot areas.
Follow the progress of that person in your mirrors.

Moke sure that the parking broke is up.
Check that the gear lever is in the neutrol position.
Remember to check that the ignition and oil warning lightsarenot on at ihis time.
Turn the igniiion key to the ON position, without starting the vehicle.
Check that all the warning lights and gouges on the doshboordareworking.
lf your vehicle hos a choke, now is the time lo use it if the car is cold.
Some cars have on outomotic choke which comes on when the vehicle storts if the driver pushes the
accelerator pedal in quickly and releases it immediately.
Turn the ignition key further until you heor the slorter motor; then give the accelerator a quick hord push,
in and out. The engine shoutd stort right oway and idle gently until you give it more fuel by depressing
the accelerator.
It is very importont that you release the key os soon os the engine storts. lf not, you will ruin the storter mobr.
Keep your eyes on the doshboord to check that the warning lights and gqugesarenot molfunctioning.
Also check thol there is enough fuel in the tonk.
Now put your seat belt on.
Ensure that both front and reqr passengers know how lo use and release their seat belts if necessory-
By now you might have to concel the choke if the car is rewing too high. Once you pull off you will be
oble to tell if the car needs the choke for a little longer by the way the engine behaves.
Your inslrucror wil! show you how the clufch control works using fhe illustrotions on rhe ri/r
To move off genrly you will have to leorn how lo bqlonce rhe clufch and qccelerotor.
Ensure that the hand broke is up and the gear is in neutrol then stort the engine.
Using your left foot, push the clutch in completely and select first gear. (See Right Fig.l)
To move off slowly without the vehicle ierking or stalling, depress the occelerolor slowly. You will heor
the engine rewing slightly (if your vehicle is fitted with a rev counter, toke it up to obout 'l OOO r.p.m.),
Then eose the clutch pedal out until you feel the reor end of the vehicle drog slightly, or see the bonnet lift,
depending on your vehicle (wiih a rev counter you can see the revs drop to obout 250 r.p.m.)
(See Right Fig.2 & Fig.3)
When clutch and accelerator balance is achieved (remember to keep your feel deod still at this time),
release the hand broke, then put your hand bock onto the steering wheel ond, without doing onything else,
you will feel and see the vehicle moving forword slowly.
When it hos moved forword a few metres and the rewing hos settled, release the clutch pedal slowly while
toneously depressing the accelerator pedal. lf you keep your heel ogoinst the floor you will
find that you have more control over the clufch. (See Below Fig. ).

. First check your reor-view mirror to ensure that the road is safe behind you.
. Then release the accelerator smoothly lo prevent a ierk. Remember to keep both hands on the steering
wheel uniil the vehicle is stationery. Move in a stroight line in case the brakes lock and you lose conkol
of the vehicle. To prevent locking, do not push the broke pedal in too hord or fost.
While you arebecoming occustomed to the vehicle's brakes, push the broke pedal in slowly until you feelthe
speed dropping steodily. Keep your foot still at this time. You will notice that using sofler or horder pressure
on the broke pedal gives you different stopping distances, and that these change at different speeds.
. Now push the cluich in quickly with your lefr foot & keep the pressure on the broke unril the vehicle stops.
To prevent a ierky stop, reduce the pressure on the broke pedal grodually os the vehicle comes to a hoh. . Then immediately push the brqke in ogoin to prevenl onother movemenl.
Your inslruclor will osk you to stop at designoted lines which imitote the position where you woutd stop oi a stop
sign or robot. Your instructor will olso show you how to broke before engoging the clutch, so that the stop is os
smooth os possible.
When the vehicle is in first gear, and moving slowly, ensure that your legsareas stroight os possible.
With your hands in the correct "quorter lo three" or "ten lo t\Mo" position on the steering wheel,
(See Left Fig.l)
Turn the wheel to the right by pulling down on the right-hand side. At the some lime, slide your left hand
down the left-hand side of the steering wheel so that it meets your right hand at the botiom in the
"six lhirty" position. (See Left Fig.2)
The left hand now pushes the steering wheel up, while the righi hand slides bock to the lop of the wheel
to meet the left hand in the "lwelve o'clock" position. (See Left Fig.3)
The right hand now repeots the first motion of pulling the steering wheel down to the right.
This is the correcl "shuffle" method of steering which you must proctise until your steering is smooth. . Reloxing your hands and orms will help to prevent ierky turning movemenls. . All vehiclesaredesigned to move outomoticolly in a stroight line under level road conditions,
so remember to keep your hands gently but firmly on the steering wheel and don't rry to fight it. . This reloxed monner will allow the vehicle to help you sleer stroight forword.
As olreody exploined, you must never allow the steering wheel to spin and centre itself,
os this is a dangerous proctice that coutd unbalance the vehicle.
' To improve your stroight steering you must now proclise sleering olongside a povement.
lf your instructor feels at q loler stoge that you arenol very competent ol sleering,
he/she will toke you to a quiet area with winding roods and help you to proctise steering.
lf you use more than one vehicle, you will notice fhot the sfeering feels different on each,
especiolly if one of them is fitted with power steering. You must proctise sleering each
vehicle using the some mefhod, lo become fomiliar with the change in steering.

described above in "Moving Off" to let the vehicle move
bockwords very slowly.
This exercise must be done in on area where there is sufficient
spoce for safe monoeuvring. Using clutch control to keep ihe
vehicle moving slowly bockwords, select on obiect for behind
you and oim for it.
Use only the right hand on top of the steering wheel to help
guide the vehicle towords the obiect.
Now, keeping your hand on the steering wheel in that position,
move the wheel to the right and left to fomiliorise yourself with
the way in which the bock of the car moves in relotion to the
movement of your hand.
After doing this a number of limes to goin confidence, find q
safe area and stop the vehicle so thol your door is olongside o
long white line or povement.
Then, while leoning out of the driver's window, look behind
the vehicle and do the some kind of reversing exercise os
described above.

It is imperotive that you do everything in sequence. lf you do not study and proctise the system in sequence,
so that you areable lo perform all octions instinctively during the octuol tesl, you will not remember enough and os a result will not obtoin sufficient points to pass.
The next section covers the sequence checks done mostly during the yord test.

Leorning to do a three-point turn is very importont, since there may be occosions where you need lo turn and the
rood is eilher too narrow or lhereareno convenient driveways to pull into. lt is imperotive that you be oble to do
o three-poinl lurn os quickly and efficiently os possible so os not to endonger olher vehicles.
. Stop os close to the left-hand kerb os possible (in the demorcoted box in the tesi yord) and do all the sequence
checks described on Pg 110,111 & ll2. Move slowly forword and turn the steering wheel all the way to the right.
When the vehicle is close to the kerb (roughly one metre), or is roughly at a 90 degree ongle to the kerb,
stroighten the steering wheel (counter steer) and stop.
When you have stopped you must ogoin do the
sequence checks. Then, while moving slowly
bockwords, turn the steering wheel quickly to
the left until it locks. Once the vehicle is at o
45 degree ongle, or your steering wheel position
is posl the centre line in the road, stroighten the
sleering wheel twice (counter sieer) ond,
before touching the kerb, stop the vehicle.
When you have stopped,
you must once ogoin do the sequence checks.
Then move slowly forword towords the opposite kerb, monoeuvring the vehicle parallel to that kerb.
With the cenlre line in full view from the driver's window,stop the vehicle and pull the hand broke up.
Woit for the exominer to direct you to the nexl port of the test.
As discussed when you stop or move off the vehicle
must not move of all in a direction opposite to the
intended direction.
The some rule opplies to the incline stort.
When you slop on the incline in the yord,
keep bothhands on the steering wheel
then pull up the parking broke. lf necessory, do o
360 degree check before putting the gear into first,
obtoining clutch conlrol, and doing onother 360
degree check. Then put the parking broke down
ond, when the vehicle slorts to move off, slowly eose
the right foot down onlo the accelerator while
releosing the clutch.
This completes the yord test. The exominer will now stop you (remember the stopping procedure) and go through your tesl sheet to check whether you have kept within the points limit. Remember to switch
off the vehicle. lf you have been successful, you will now go through the starting procedure os

flow of traffic.
(3) IVlir. Checking the mirror. Check behind you for faster moving
traffic and other dongers when enfering or exiting a freeway.

THE ROAD TEST
Rood signsarecovered in the leorner's seciion. These must be leornt and
memorised, since fqilure to obey a road sign means outomotic failure during
the road test. You olso need to know when to opply the correcl sequence
of checks, in porticulor at slop and yield signs, especiolly if the exominer
instrucls you to lurn at on intersection. lf a sign requires you to slow down,
change lanes or yield, you must remember to check mirrors and blind spots in
the correct monner and to signal where necessory. Remember to stop behind
the white lines at robots and stop signs, or with the front of your vehicle
behind the sign if there areno road morkings. lf you roll even slightly you
will foil. lf during the test you encounler roodworks, detours or emergency
vehicles, don't ponic. Obey ony road signs ihotarevisible and remember ihot
emergency vehicles have right of way. Also remember to keep a safe distance
between your vehicle and other traffic.
Unless the exominer specificolly osks you to change lanes, you must not do so
unless this is indicated by a road sign or traffic morkings (e.g. where lanes
merge or a road ends). When chonging lanes, you will need to carry out o
sequence of checks:
. first check your reor-view mirror and blind spots for a cleor spoce
. if it is safe, signal your intention lo change lanes
. wotch out for road signs and morkings (e.g. do not cross a solid line)
. recheck your blind spot ond, if it is safe, move inlo the odiocent lone
. concel the signal and continue with the test.
Beware of chonging lanes in heovy traffic, and do not exceed rhe speed limir
in on oltempt to move into a spoce further ahead. Stroddling of lanes will be
penolised, os will crossing lanes while toking a corner.
You will be penolised if you do not yield to traffic where necessory, or if you
cut olher cars off. When turning a corner to the right, you must yield to traffic
coming from the opposite direction, regordless of whether theyarelurning or
going stroight. Similorly, if you areiurning left, you have right of way.
When enlering a traffic circle, you must give way to vehicles olreody in the
circle, os well os to vehicles approaching from the right.
Emergency vehicles olways have right of way and you must pull over or slop
if necessory. Pedestrians olways have right of way, both at pedestrian
crossings and at school potrols. Four-way stops can be tricky, especiolly in
heovy traffic when there areaueues of cars. You usuolly give way lo whoever
stops first at the intersection, bui if there is ony uncerlointy it is best to yield to
the right. Or simply be polite and let someone through, and thonk considerote
drivers who let you cross first.
